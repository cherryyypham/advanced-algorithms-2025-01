    "Uniform crossover would likely perform better on this scheduling problem because the shifts are highly interdependent - a controller working one shift affects their availability for other shifts. This interdependence requires more nuanced recombination that uniform crossover can provide.\n",
    "Tournament selection would likely outperform roulette wheel selection for this problem because it maintains more diversity, which is crucial for exploring the complex, constrained scheduling space where small changes can have large ripple effects across the solution."
